<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMOS Image Sensor for Vehicle-Mounted Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Front-illuminated (FSI) CMOS Sensor</li><li>Backside-illuminated (BSI) CMOS Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CMOS image sensors used in vehicle-mounted cameras are pivotal for enhancing safety and navigation. Front-illuminated (FSI) CMOS sensors capture images using a traditional design where light enters through the front, achieving adequate performance in good lighting. Conversely, backside-illuminated (BSI) CMOS sensors position the light-sensitive area at the back, reducing light obstruction and improving sensitivity, particularly in low-light conditions. This makes BSI sensors increasingly preferred for applications like night vision and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).</p></p>
