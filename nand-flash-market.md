<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The NAND Flash Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>MLC NAND</li><li>TLC NAND</li></ul></p>
<p><p>NAND Flash memory is categorized into several types based on the number of bits stored per cell, primarily MLC (Multi-Level Cell) and TLC (Triple-Level Cell). MLC stores two bits per cell, offering a balance of performance, endurance, and cost, making it suitable for enterprise applications and high-end consumer products. TLC, on the other hand, stores three bits per cell, providing higher density and lower costs, ideal for consumer electronics and budget-friendly solutions, though it may sacrifice speed and durability compared to MLC.</p></p>
