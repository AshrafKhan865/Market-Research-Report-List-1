<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AC Dynamometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Cooled</li><li>Water Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The AC dynamometers market is divided into two main types: air-cooled and water-cooled dynamometers. Air-cooled dynamometers utilize ambient air to dissipate heat generated during operation, making them simpler and easier to maintain. They are often suitable for smaller applications with moderate loads. In contrast, water-cooled dynamometers use a water circulation system to manage heat, allowing for greater efficiency and performance in high-load scenarios. This makes them ideal for rigorous testing applications in automotive and industrial settings.</p></p>
