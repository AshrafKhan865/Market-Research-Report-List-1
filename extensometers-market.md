<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extensometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Extensometers</li><li>Non-contact Extensometers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The extensometers market is divided into two primary types: contact and non-contact extensometers. Contact extensometers measure strain by physically attaching to the specimen, using sensors that convert elongation or compression into electrical signals. They are ideal for precise measurements on static samples. In contrast, non-contact extensometers utilize optical or laser technologies to assess strain without physical contact, making them suitable for dynamic conditions and sensitive materials. Both types serve crucial roles in material testing and structural monitoring.</p></p>
