<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LMD 3D Printing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Noncontact Displacement Sensor Type</li><li>Contact Displacement Sensor Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>LMD (Laser Metal Deposition) 3D printing technology utilizes various displacement sensor types to ensure precision during the printing process. Noncontact displacement sensors use laser or optical techniques to measure surface distances without physical contact, enhancing speed and reducing wear. In contrast, contact displacement sensors directly touch the workpiece, providing accurate measurements but potentially influencing the surface integrity. Both types play crucial roles in optimizing the printing process by ensuring consistent layer thickness and adherence to design specifications.</p></p>
