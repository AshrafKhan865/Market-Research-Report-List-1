<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Worm Gearbox Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-enveloping Worm Gearbox</li><li>Single-envelop Worm Gearbox</li><li>Double-envelop Worm Gearbox</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The worm gearbox market comprises three main types: non-enveloping, single-enveloping, and double-enveloping worm gearboxes. Non-enveloping worm gearboxes feature a straight worm thread that engages with a gear, providing basic functionality. Single-enveloping gearboxes have a single helix, allowing for increased efficiency and load capacity. In contrast, double-enveloping gearboxes utilize two helical worms, enhancing torque transmission and minimizing backlash, making them suitable for heavy-duty applications. These variations cater to diverse industrial needs and performance requirements.</p></p>
