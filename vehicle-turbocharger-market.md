<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Turbocharger Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical Turbocharging</li><li>Exhaust Turbocharging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Vehicle Turbocharger Market includes **Mechanical Turbocharging** and **Exhaust Turbocharging**. Mechanical Turbocharging uses a belt or gear-driven compressor to force air into the engine, enhancing power output. Exhaust Turbocharging leverages exhaust gases to spin a turbine, which drives a compressor to increase air intake, improving efficiency and performance. Both systems boost engine power, but Exhaust Turbocharging is more common due to its energy recovery from exhaust gases, making it more efficient and widely adopted in modern vehicles.</p></p>
